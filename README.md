A data-heavy spreadsheet can be difficult to read through and process. If you’re using Google Sheets, adding graphs to your spreadsheet can help you present this information differently for easier reading. Here’s how you can add graphs to your spreadsheet.

Before we begin, you should be aware of a slight difference in terminology. Like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets refers to all types of graphs as charts. You can use the Chart Editor tool to create these graphs and charts in Google Sheets.


## Make a Graph in Google Sheets

**Creating a graph in Google Sheets is fairly simple as long as you're logged into your Google account.**

1. Open your Google Sheet, or create a new one by going to sheets.new and inputting your data into a sheet.

2. Select the cells you want to use in your chart by clicking the first cell and holding shift on your Mac or PC keyboard while selecting the other cells you want to include.

3. In the top toolbar, select **"Insert"** and then **"Chart."**

4. Your chart or graph will then appear over your spreadsheet. Google Sheets will select whichever chart it deems as the best option for your data. However, you can always change the kind of chart or graph used by clicking the drop-down menu in the chart editor, located on the right-hand side of the screen.
